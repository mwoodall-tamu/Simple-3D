# Simple-3D
## Description
Simple-3D is a python .obj renderer built in pygame. Simple-3D is designed for rendering retro style 3D models and letting users see how their geomotry looks. This is a modification of a previouse 3D renderer build on turtle the specialized in isometric projections of .stl files.

## Future Goals
  1. In app menus
  2. Support for .stl files
  3. Loading different / multiple models
  4. Rendering textures
  5. Rendering smooth normals
  6. More sophisticated lighting system
  7. Full PBR texture support
